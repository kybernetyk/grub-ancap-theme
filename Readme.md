# Ancap Grub 2 Theme

This is a theme for the Grub 2 bootloader featuring a yellow/black theme and Murray.

Fuck the state. Taxation is theft.

## Installation

Copy the ancap folder to /usr/share/grub/themes and then run `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

## Acknowledgements

I took the Shodan Grub 2 theme and replaced the background image + changed the colors from green to yellow. So all credit goes really to the Shodan theme author.

## License

I put this under MIT but I have no idea what the original license was. So yeah ... (intellectual property is theft so who cares)
